This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where a necessary dependency for test execution is missing, leading to build failures. The bug is that the Dockerfile doesn't install the `unittest` module, even though it's used in the `CMD` instruction.  The solution adds the installation of `python3-unittest` to fix this.
